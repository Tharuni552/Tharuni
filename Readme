GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.
First let us know what is version control.It helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code.
Version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository).
The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.
Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code back into the main source code to make it official.
Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.
GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service.
It makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
Anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects.
